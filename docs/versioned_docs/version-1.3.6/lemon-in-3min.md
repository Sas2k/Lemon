# Lemon in 3 minutes

Let's try to create a site in **Lemon üçã**..

## Getting Started

To get started first install Lemon üçã from pip

```
pip install Lemon-Library
```

## Generate a new site

to generate a new site run this command

```
create-lemon-app my-website
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
python app.py
```

then visit localhost:8000

The `cd` command changes the current directory to the website dir,

next the `python app.py` runs the app.

Now that you done this, head over to the [tutorial](tutorial/intro-to-tutorial), to create a basic app.
