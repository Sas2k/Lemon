Let's try to create a site in **Lemon 🍋**..

## Getting Started

To get started first install Lemon 🍋 from pip

```
pip install Lemon-Library
```

## Generate a new site

to generate a new site run this command

```
create-next-app my-website
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

The `cd` command changes the current directory to the website dir,

next the `python app.py` runs the app.
